Emily would be on the other side and would flip a **fair coin**. Depending on how the coin landed, she would put out either her left hand or her right hand. The TT practitioner would then have to answer which hand Emily put out. If a practitioner could truly interact with a person's HEF, it would be expected that they answered correctly. \n",
